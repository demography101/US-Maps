# US-Maps

This is the code I use to create US maps with a variety of different data sources.

This code includes how to create maps on a national level and a state-level to look at county level data.

I also included how to animate maps through ggplot while using the geom_statebins() command.

I have also included the unemployment data I used that I obtained from the Bureau Labor of Statistics (BLS).
